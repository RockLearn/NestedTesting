# Impact Player Analysis 

## Introduction

Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, having originated in England in the late 16th century. It is played in numerous countries, including India, Australia, Scotland, South Africa, England, Ireland,etc. The game consists of two innings, with each team taking turns to bowl and bat. The decision of which team bats first is determined by a coin toss. The team batting first sets a target score for the opposing team to chase within a set number of overs, which varies based on the format. Cricket is played in three major formats: Test matches (lasting five days), One Day Internationals (50 overs), and Twenty20 (20 overs). An over includes six balls. 

In India, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is immensely popular and well-known internationally. It follows the Twenty20 format and features two teams of eleven players each, along with four to five substitutes.

With the introduction of the Impact Player rule last year(2023), teams can now list four/five substitutes at the toss and use any one of them as their Impact Player, adding a new tactical and strategic dimension to the game.
